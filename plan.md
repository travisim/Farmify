# AgriVest XRPL MVP - XRPL-Native Implementation Plan

**Document Version: 4.0 (Enhanced with Detailed Project & Page Specifications)**  
**Date: December 2024**  
**Objective: Build a working agricultural funding platform that maximizes XRPL native data storage capabilities**

## 1. MVP Scope & Core Value Proposition

**What we're building:** A platform where farmers can create agricultural projects and investors can fund them using RLUSD (Ripple USD stablecoin), with transparent tracking and profit-sharing using XRPL's native data storage capabilities.

**XRPL-First Architecture:**

- Store all project metadata directly on XRPL using NFTs and memo fields
- Use XRPL account objects for user profiles and settings
- Leverage transaction history for audit trails
- Process investments and returns using RLUSD for price stability
- Minimize external database dependencies

## 2. Technology Stack (XRPL-Optimized, with XRP EVM Sidechain)

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes
- **Primary Storage:** XRPL (NFTs, memos, account objects, transaction metadata), XRP EVM Sidechain (for smart contract state)
- **Transaction Currency:** RLUSD (Ripple USD stablecoin on XRPL and potentially wrapped on EVM)
- **Minimal Database:** SQLite for caching and indexing only
- **XRPL Integration:** xrpl.js library (for XRPL mainnet interactions)
- **XRP EVM Integration:** ethers.js / web3.js, Solidity, Hardhat/Truffle
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js with wallet connection (supporting both XRPL and EVM accounts if necessary)

  },
};
```

## 5. XRPL-Native Data Architecture

### 5.1 Enhanced Project Data Storage (NFTs + URIs)

**Advanced Project NFT Structure:**

```json
{
  "NFTokenTaxon": 1, // Reserved for agricultural projects
  "URI": "data:application/json,{\"v\":\"1.0\",\"t\":\"Rice Farm Project\",\"c\":\"rice\",\"l\":\"Thailand\",\"g\":1000,\"d\":180,\"roi\":15,\"cat\":\"crop\",\"risk\":\"medium\",\"cert\":[\"organic\"],\"stage\":\"funding\"}",
  "Flags": 8, // tfTransferable=false to make soulbound
  "TransferFee": 0
}
```

**Extended Project Data via Memo Transactions:**

```typescript
// Detailed project information stored in follow-up memo transactions
const extendedProjectData = {
  MemoType: "5052454A4458540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // "PROJEXT"
  MemoData: JSON.stringify({
    nftId: "project_nft_id",
    budget: {
      seeds: 15000,
      fertilizer: 8000,
      labor: 12000,
      equipment: 10000,
      misc: 5000,
    },
    timeline: [
      {
        stage: "preparation",
        start: "2024-01-01",
        end: "2024-01-14",
        description: "Land preparation and soil testing",
      },
      {
        stage: "planting",
        start: "2024-01-15",
        end: "2024-01-21",
        description: "Seed planting and initial care",
      },
      {
        stage: "growing",
        start: "2024-01-22",
        end: "2024-05-21",
        description: "Growth period with regular care",
      },
      {
        stage: "harvest",
        start: "2024-05-22",
        end: "2024-06-05",
        description: "Harvesting and processing",
      },
    ],
    farmerDetails: {
      experience: 12,
      specialization: "organic_rice",
      previousProjects: ["proj1_nft_id", "proj2_nft_id"],
      certifications: ["organic_certified", "sustainable_farming"],
    },
  }),
};
```

### 5.2 User Profile Storage (Account Settings + Document Storage Pattern)

**Using AccountSet Domain Field:**

- Store user type and basic profile in account's Domain field
- Use well-known memo patterns for extended profile data

```typescript
// User profile stored in account domain + memos
const profileMemo = {
  MemoType: "41475249545255535400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // "AGRITRUST"
  MemoData: JSON.stringify({
    userType: "farmer", // or "investor"
    name: "John Doe",
    location: "Thailand",
    experience: 5,
  }),
};
```

### 5.3 Investment Tracking (Payment Transactions + Memos)

**Direct RLUSD payments with structured memos:**

- Each investment = RLUSD payment to farmer's account
- Investment details stored in transaction memo fields
- Automatic investment tracking via transaction history

```json
// Investment transaction structure
{
  "TransactionType": "Payment",
  "Account": "investor_address",
  "Destination": "farmer_address",
  "Amount": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "value": "1000",
    "issuer": "rN7n7otQDd6FczFgLdSqtcsAUxDkw6fzRH"
  },
  "Memos": [
    {
      "Memo": {
        "MemoType": "494E56455354000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // "INVEST"
        "MemoData": "NFTokenID_of_project_being_funded"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5.4 Project Updates (Memo Transactions)

**Status updates via minimal XRP transactions:**

- Farmers post updates as minimal XRP transactions to themselves (for transaction fees)
- Update content stored in memo fields
- Chronological update history maintained on-ledger

```json
// Project update transaction
{
  "TransactionType": "Payment",
  "Account": "farmer_address",
  "Destination": "farmer_address",
  "Amount": "1", // 1 drop minimum for transaction fee
  "Memos": [{
    "Memo": {
      "MemoType": "555044415445000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", // "UPDATE"
      "MemoData": JSON.stringify({
        project: "NFTokenID",
        message: "Planting completed, 90% of seeds germinated",
        stage: "growing",
        timestamp: Date.now()
      })
    }
  }]
}
```

### 5.5 Returns Distribution (Payment Transactions)

**Profit sharing via direct RLUSD payments:**

- Returns calculated based on on-ledger investment records
- Direct RLUSD payments to investors with memo indicating source project
- All distribution history permanently recorded on-ledger

## 6. Minimal Database Schema (Caching/Indexing Only)

```sql
-- Lightweight cache for faster queries
CREATE TABLE project_cache (
  nft_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  farmer_account TEXT NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  total_funding INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  last_updated INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Investment cache for quick portfolio views
CREATE TABLE investment_cache (
  tx_hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  investor_account TEXT NOT NULL,
  project_nft_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  amount_rlusd DECIMAL(15,6) NOT NULL,
  timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- User cache for faster profile lookups
CREATE TABLE user_cache (
  account_address TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_name TEXT,
  last_sync INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

## 7. Core User Flows (XRPL-Native)

### Flow 1: Farmer Creates Project

1. Connect wallet → Verify/set user type in Domain field
2. Fill project form → Mint NFT with project metadata in URI field
3. Project immediately available (no approval needed - decentralized)

### Flow 2: Investor Funds Project

1. Connect wallet → Browse projects via NFT queries
2. Select project → Send RLUSD payment with investment memo
3. Investment automatically recorded on-ledger

### Flow 3: Project Updates & Returns

1. Farmer posts updates → Send memo transactions to self (minimal XRP for fees)
2. Project completion → Calculate returns from on-ledger investment data
3. Distribute returns → Send RLUSD payments to investors with memo

## 8. Trusted Settlement Mechanism

### 8.1 Overview

The Trusted Settlement mechanism is the cornerstone of transparency and trust in the AgriVest platform. After a farming project's duration ends and produce is harvested and sold, this system ensures that all profit distributions are backed by verifiable, real-world proof of revenue through a combination of IPFS document storage and XRPL immutable records.

### 8.2 Settlement Flow Architecture

**Three-Party Verification System:**

- **Farmer**: Uploads proof of sales (invoices, receipts)
- **Admin**: Verifies authenticity and notarizes on XRPL
- **Investors**: Receive transparent, verifiable settlement reports

**Technical Stack:**

- **Document Storage**: IPFS for decentralized invoice storage
- **Proof Recording**: XRPL memo transactions with document hashes
- **Automatic Distribution**: Smart contract-like logic for profit sharing
- **Verification Trail**: Immutable audit trail on public ledger

### 8.3 Farmer Settlement Experience

#### Settlement Dashboard Interface

**Project Status Progression:**

```typescript
interface ProjectStatusFlow {
  activeStates: [
    "funding", // Initial funding phase
    "active", // Project in progress

    "settlement_required", // ⭐ NEW: Proof upload needed
    "verification_pending", // Admin verification in progress
    "completed" // Final state with distributions made
  ];
}
```

## 9. XRPL Integration Details

### 9.1 NFT Management

```typescript
// Create project NFT
const projectNFT = {
  TransactionType: "NFTokenMint",
  Account: farmerAddress,
  NFTokenTaxon: 1, // Agricultural projects
  URI: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(projectData)).toString("hex"),
  Flags: 8, // Non-transferable
};

// Query farmer's projects
const projects = await client.request({
  command: "account_nfts",
  account: farmerAddress,
  nft_filter: { nft_taxon: 1 },
});
```

### 9.2 Transaction Parsing

```typescript
// Parse investment transactions
const investments = await client.request({
  command: "account_tx",
  account: farmerAddress,
  transaction_type: "Payment",
});

// Filter for investment memos
const investmentTxs = investments.transactions.filter((tx) =>
  tx.Memos?.some(
    (memo) => Buffer.from(memo.Memo.MemoType, "hex").toString() === "INVEST"
  )
);
```

### 9.3 Real-time Updates

```typescript
// Subscribe to account transactions for live updates
client.subscribe({
  streams: ["transactions"],
  accounts: [farmerAddress, investorAddress],
});

client.on("transaction", (tx) => {
  if (isInvestmentTx(tx)) {
    updateProjectFunding(tx);
